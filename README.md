# WebApp with React JS and Flask API

Welcome to Bemyre, the Musician Social Network App! This application is designed to connect musicians in your local area and keep you updated on live music events happening in your city. Whether you're a musician looking to collaborate, a fan seeking new talent, or simply someone who enjoys live music, this app has you covered.

This has been my first project as a programmer where I demonstrate part of what I have learned in my training up until February 2023. I hope you like it!
